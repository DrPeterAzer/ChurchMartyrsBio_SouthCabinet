  <h2>St. Mercurius (Abu Sefein)</h2>
  <p>
    He was called “Abu Sefein” (the one with two swords) because the Angel of the Lord appeared to him and gave him a sword alongside his military sword. This heavenly sword was the secret of his strength.
  </p>

  <h2>Birth and Childhood</h2>
  <p>
    He was born around 224 A.D. to pagan parents who named him Philopater, meaning “Lover of the Father.” His father, Yares, was a Roman officer, and Philopater himself was a successful soldier who rose to the rank of <i>Primicerius</i>.
  </p>

  <h2>Yares the Beast Hunter</h2>
  <p>
    His father Yares and grandfather Phyros hunted wild beasts like lions and tigers, offering them to kings and nobles in return for rewards. One day, while hunting, two strange beasts fell into their trap, but they broke free and attacked. The beasts devoured Phyros, and Yares fainted at the sight of his father’s death. As the beasts advanced on him, he heard a voice from heaven telling him that Jesus Christ could tame them and make them as meek as lambs. Christ appeared and said:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    “O Yares, I am the Lord Jesus Christ, your God who loves you and has delivered you from these beasts.  
    I call you to the light of faith. You shall be my chosen vessel, and I have chosen your son to be a fruitful tree bearing my name before kings and rulers.  
    He will suffer greatly for my sake, but I will be your shield and deliverer.”
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    When Yares returned home after three days, he shared his vision with his wife, who had heard the same heavenly voice calling her to believe in Christ.
  </p>

  <h2>Baptism of Yares and His Household</h2>
  <p>
    Yares, his wife, and his son were baptized by the bishop, who gave them new names: Yares became Noah, his wife became Sephina, and Philopater was named Mercurius. From that time on, the family lived blamelessly, keeping God’s commandments and practicing charity abundantly.
  </p>

  <h2>Noah’s Capture</h2>
  <p>
    News of their conversion reached the prince, who ordered the family to be thrown to wild beasts. But the Lord shut the beasts’ mouths, and they did not harm them. Amazed, the prince released Noah and appointed him head of the army. Later, Noah was captured in battle by the Barbarians and remained their prisoner for over a year, during which he gained favor with their king and was made a ruler. By God’s providence, he returned home, reuniting with his family, and soon after departed in peace.
  </p>

  <h2>Abu Sefein</h2>
  <p>
    After Noah’s death, Emperor Decius appointed Mercurius to succeed him. When Barbarians threatened Rome, the emperor trembled, but Mercurius encouraged him and personally led the army.  
    The Angel of the Lord appeared to Mercurius, clothed in light, carrying a shining sword, and said:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    “Mercurius, servant of Jesus Christ, do not fear. Take this sword and go against the Barbarians. Remember your God when you are victorious.  
    I am Archangel Michael, sent by God to strengthen you. You will suffer much for Christ’s name, but I will be with you until you complete your testimony.”
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    Mercurius joyfully received the sword and felt divine power filling him. Armed with two swords — his own and the one given by the angel — he fought and defeated the Barbarians and their king.
  </p>

  <h2>The Imperial Edict</h2>
  <p>
    While God granted victory, Satan stirred Decius to wage war against the Church. He issued a decree:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    “From Decius, Emperor of Rome: Let it be known that the gods of our ancestors granted us victory. Therefore, all must worship them and offer incense. Whoever obeys shall receive honor, but whoever disobeys shall be tortured and put to death.”
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    Some denied the faith, but many stood firm, enduring prison and martyrdom.
  </p>

  <h2>The Refusal of Mercurius</h2>
  <p>
    After the victory celebration, Decius noticed Mercurius absent from the pagan rituals. When summoned, Mercurius threw off his military garments and declared:  
    <b>“I will never deny my God, Jesus Christ.”</b>  
    Enraged, the emperor ordered him to be tortured: his body was torn with sharp blades, and burning coals were pressed against his sides.
  </p>

  <h2>Divine Care Amid Suffering</h2>
  <p>
    The Archangel Michael appeared, healed his wounds, and gave him peace. Seeing him unharmed the next day, the emperor increased the tortures — laying him on burning iron and hanging him upside down with a heavy stone around his neck. Yet each time, the angel healed him.  
    Finally, fearing the people, Decius sent him to Caesarea in Cappadocia, where he was sentenced to death by beheading in 250 A.D. His body shone at the moment of martyrdom, and many miracles occurred at his burial.
  </p>

  <h2>After His Martyrdom</h2>
  <p>
    After the end of persecutions, God allowed his body to be revealed. The faithful placed it in Caesarea, later building a church in his honor.
  </p>

  <h2>St. Basil and Emperor Julian</h2>
  <p>
    Tradition says St. Basil invoked Mercurius’ intercession against Julian the Apostate. While Julian fought the Persians, Mercurius appeared as a soldier from heaven, pierced him with a spear, and killed him. At that moment, the icon of St. Mercurius, which Basil had been praying before in prison, appeared stained with blood, confirming the miracle.
  </p>
  <p>
    Today, there is a convent in Old Cairo named after St. Mercurius (Abu Sefein), where thousands come seeking blessings.
